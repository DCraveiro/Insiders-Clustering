# Insiders Clustering

**This is an ongoing project.**

It is being developed in cycles in order to always produce results.
Currently, the exploratory data analysis is being developed along with different embedding spaces in order to identify the best features to be used with the ML models.

## This project has the goal of identifying similarity amongst people, in order to find the most valuable clients to join a loyalty program.

# 1. Business Problem.

Find the most significant customers in an online retail store using the data collected during approximately a year, in order to build an Insiders program for the most loyal clients. The dataset used is available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/vik2012kvs/high-value-customers-identification). 

# 2. Business Assumptions.

## Objective
Engage the best customers to buy even more and to be loyal to the retail.

## Questions to be answered
- Who are the elegible people for the insiders program?
- How many will integrate the insiders program?
- What are the main characteristics of those clients?
- What is the revenue in percentage brought by those clients?
- What is the expected revenue brought by those clients in the next few months?
- What are the conditions to make a person elegible to the insiders program?
- What are the conditions to remove a person from the insiders program?
- With which warranty does the insiders program ensure it is better marketing strategy than the rest of the marketing plan?
- What actions may the marketing team apply to raise the revenue?

# 3. Solution Strategy

The adopted strategy to solve this challenge was the following:

**Step 01. Data Description:** The goal was using basic statistical metrics to describe the behaviour of the present data.

**Step 02. Data Filtering:** Filter rows and select columns that may contain or not valuable information for modeling the present problem.

**Step 03. Feature Engineering:** Derive new attributes based on the original features in order to describe the phenomenon in a better way.

**Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis:** Data exploration to find insights and better understand the impact of each feature when clustering the clients, including possible embedding spaces for the features.

**Step 05. Data Preparation:**

**Step 06. Feature Selection:**

**Step 07. Machine Learning Modelling:**

**Step 08. Hyperparameter Fine Tunning:**

**Step 09. Convert Model Performance to Business Values:**

**Step 10. Deploy Modelo to Production:**
